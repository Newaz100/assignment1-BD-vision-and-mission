                <p>Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 2006 for their work to “create economic and social development from below”. Grameen Bank's objective since its establishment in 1983 has been to grant poor people small loans on easy terms - so-called micro-credit - and Yunus was the bank's founder. "Poverty is not created by the poor. It is created by the system we have built, the institutions we have designed, and the concepts we have formulated."
                    This quote emphasizes that poverty is not an inherent condition or a personal failing of individuals. Instead, it is the result of structural issues like flawed policies, unequal opportunities, and unfair economic systems. Dr. Yunus argues that systemic barriers—such as lack of access to education, healthcare, and financial services—trap people in poverty. To eliminate poverty, he advocates for transforming these systems to ensure fairness, inclusivity, and access to resources for all.</p><br><br>
